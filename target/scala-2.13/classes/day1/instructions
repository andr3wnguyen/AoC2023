--- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---


You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map
looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from")
when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").

As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input)
has been amended by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the
Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.

The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration
value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit
and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For example:

1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.

Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?


->
for each line, get the first instance of an int and the last of an int and concatenate them.
then, add all the values together.
** if only one int is found, concatenate it to itself **

pseudocode
**reader to read in code**
for each line:
            filter only integers
            take first value and last value
            (if filtered list is length 1, then take the first value twice)
            add this to another list and sum. (OR, create a counter that adds)



--- Part Two ---

Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".

Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:

two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.

What is the sum of all of the calibration values?

--> foreach line, now check the sequence to see if it spells out a number.
if it does, then convert that to a number in the string
do th esame as above


pseduocode
-> create a value/case match one to ten string to int. -> convert string so that any instance of a 'numberAsAsString' is converted to the digit value
-> filter out
-> same process as above

NOPE

listOfNumbers

if string exists in listOfNumbers


-> remove all the junk:
 -> go through the list and extract every value of number/numberString into a list
        -> have a list of numbers, if it exists -
 -> from that list, use indexOf to get the indexs and order the list by this
 -> get the first and last from this list
 -> repeat p1
